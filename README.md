Typical Push To Repo

    Click on the Git icon, you will see all untracked files labeled with a "U" to the right of them.
    Enter a message in the message box (e.g. first commit) then click the checkmark. The "U" will disappear as the files are now being tracked.
    To push the files up to the repo, click on the "..." and select "Push". Enter your username and pasword at the prompt.
    You can go to git page and refresh it to see the changes.
